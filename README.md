### How to use
Go to [http://cerebral-website.herokuapp.com/documentation/cerebral-module-useragent](http://cerebral-website.herokuapp.com/documentation/cerebral-module-useragent)

## User agent parser

I am using the [ua-parser-js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ua-parser-js) package to parse `navigator.userAgent`. Currently only the browser, device and OS parts are stored in the model, because I didn't see any use for cpu and engine.

## Window

The window resize event is just slightly throttled using `requestAnimationFrame()`. I might make this configurable to use a stronger throttle timeout if it proofs to be too resource hungry.

## Media queries

The media queries are tested with `matchMedia()` so you should be able to use any valid CSS media query.

## Feature detection

I am using the [feature.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/feature.js) package to detect browser features. Please checkout the website to see a list of all supported feature tests.

You can also only store certain test results in the model or define your own tests.

```javascript
const useragent = Useragent({
  feature: {
    touch: true,
    serviceWorker: true,
    getUserMedia: () => !!navigator.getUserMedia
  }
})
```
> All tests from `feature.js` are executed even if you set the feature option to false. This is a limitation of the library.

## Network detection

I am using the [offline-js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/offline-js) package to detect internet connectivity. The application is initially assumed to be online.
